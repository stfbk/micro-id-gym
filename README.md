# Micro-Id-Gym (MIG)

Micro-Id-Gym (MIG) aims to assist system administrators and testers in the deployment and pen-testing of IdM protocol instances.

## Features

- Setup and deploy a custom SSO solution based on SAML and OIDC/OAuth
- Run automated tests to discover vulnerabilities in the implementation of SSO based on SAML and OIDC/OAuth
- Graphically represents the authentication flow as message sequence chart and deeply inspect it
- Access Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) information to assess how a vulnerability can be exploited and how severe it is
